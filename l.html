    <dt><strong>Linux :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A UNIX - like, open-source operating system developed primarily by Linus Torvalds. Linux is free and runs on
      many platforms, including both PCs and Macintoshes. Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning that the
      source code of the operating system is freely available to the public. Programmers may redistribute and modify the
      code, as long as they don't collect royalties on their work or deny access to their code. Since development is not
      restricted to a single corporation more programmers can debug and improve the source code faster.</dd>
