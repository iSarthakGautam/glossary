    <dd>Short for extensible markup language, XML is a specification developed by W3C starting with the recommendation
      on February 10, 1998. XML is similar to HTML in that XML uses tags to markup a document, allowing the browser to
      interpret and display the information. However, unlike HTML, XML language is unlimited (extensible). It allows
      tags to define themselves, and can describe the content instead of only displaying a page's content. Using XML
      other languages such as RSS and MathML were created, even tools like XSLT were created using XML.</dd>
