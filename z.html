    <dt><strong>Zip drive :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A Zip drive and Zip disk is a hardware data storage device developed by Iomega that functions like a standard
      1.44" floppy drive and diskette. What makes the Iomega Zip drive unique is its capability to hold up to 100 MB,
      250 MB, or 750 MB of data on the later models. Iomega Zip drives became popular in late 1990s but quickly became
      less popular as users needed larger storage capabilities. The drive was eventually replaced by CD-R and CD-RW
      drives and discs as they became cheaper since they offered more storage and compatibility.
