      view them again without reconnecting to the Web.</dd>

    <br>
    <dt><strong>CAD-CAM :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Computer Aided Drawing - Computer Aided Manufacturing. The instructions stored in a computer that will be
      translated to very precise operating instructions to a robot, such as for assembling cars or laser-cutting
      signage.

      <br>
    <dt><strong>CD-ROM :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Compact Disc Read-Only Memory, an optically read disc designed to hold information such as music, reference
      materials, or computer software. A single CD-ROM can hold around 640 megabytes of data, enough for several
      encyclopaedias. Most software programs are now delivered on CD-ROMs.

      <br>
    <dt><strong>CGI :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Common Gateway Interface, a programming standard that allows visitors to fill out form fields on a Web page and
      have that information interact with a database, possibly coming back to the user as another Web page. CGI may also
      refer to Computer-Generated Imaging, the process in which sophisticated computer programs create still and
      animated graphics, such as special effects for movies.</dd>

    <br>
    <dt><strong>Client :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A single user of a network application that is operated from a server. A client/server architecture allows many

    <dt><strong>Cyberspace :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Slang for internet ie. An international conglomeration of interconnected computer networks. Begun in the late
      1960s, it was developed in the 1970s to allow government and university researchers to share information. The
      Internet is not controlled by any single group or organization. Its original focus was research and
      communications, but it continues to expand, offering a wide array of resources for business and home users.</dd>
