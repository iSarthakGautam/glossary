    <br><dt><strong>Icons :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Symbols or illustrations appearing on the computer screen that indicate program files or other computer
      functions.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Input :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Data that goes into a computer device.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Input device :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A device, such as a keyboard, stylus and tablet, mouse, puck, or microphone, that allows input of information
      (letters, numbers, sound, video) to a computer.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Instant messaging (IM) :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A chat application that allows two or more people to communicate over the Internet via real-time keyed-in
      messages.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Interface :</strong></dt>
    <dd>The interconnections that allow a device, a program, or a person to interact. Hardware interfaces are the cables
      that connect the device to its power source and to other devices. Software interfaces allow the program to
      communicate with other programs (such as the operating system), and user interfaces allow the user to communicate
      with the program (e.g., via mouse, menu commands, icons, voice commands, etc.).</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Internet :</strong></dt>
    <dd>An international conglomeration of interconnected computer networks. Begun in the late 1960s, it was developed
      in the 1970s to allow government and university researchers to share information. The Internet is not controlled
      by any single group or organization. Its original focus was research and communications, but it continues to
      expand, offering a wide array of resources for business and home users.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>IP (Internet Protocol) address :</strong></dt>
    <dd>An Internet Protocol address is a unique set of numbers used to locate another computer on a network. The format
      of an IP address is a 32-bit string of four numbers separated by periods. Each number can be from 0 to 255 (i.e.,
      1.154.10.255). Within a closed network IP addresses may be assigned at random, however, IP addresses of web
      servers must be registered to avoid duplicates.</dd>
