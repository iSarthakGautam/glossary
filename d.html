          to 30 Gb (gigabytes).</li>

        <li>A floppy disc, 3.5" square, usually inserted into the computer and can store about 1.4 megabytes of data.
          The 3.5" square floppies have a very thin, flexible disc inside. There is also an intermediate-sized floppy
          disc, trademarked Zip discs, which can store 250 megabytes of data.</li>
