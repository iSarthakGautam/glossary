    <br><dt><strong>Open source :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Computer programs whose original source code was revealed to the general public so that it could be developed
      openly. Software licensed as open source can be freely changed or adapted to new uses, meaning that the source
      code of the operating system is freely available to the public. Programmers may redistribute and modify the code,
      as long as they don't collect royalties on their work or deny access to their code. Since development is not
      restricted to a single corporation more programmers can debug and improve the source code faster.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Operating system :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A set of instructions that tell a computer on how to operate when it is turned on. It sets up a filing system to
      store files and tells the computer how to display information on a video display. Most PC operating systems are
      DOS (disc operated system) systems, meaning the instructions are stored on a disc (as opposed to being originally
      stored in the microprocessors of the computer). Other well-known operating systems include UNIX, Linux, Macintosh,
      and Windows.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Output :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Data that come out of a computer device. For example, information displayed on the monitor, sound from the
      speakers, and information printed to paper.</dd>
