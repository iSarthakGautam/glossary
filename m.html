  <dl>
    <br><dt><strong>Macro :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A script that operates a series of commands to perform a function. It is set up to automate repetitive tasks.
    </dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Mac OS :</strong></dt>
    <dd>An operating system with a graphical user interface, developed by Apple for Macintosh computers. Current System
      X.1.(10) combines the traditional Mac interface with a strong underlying UNIX. Operating system for increased
      performance and stability.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Megabyte (MB) :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Equal to 1,048,576 bytes, usually rounded off to one million bytes (also called a meg).</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Memory :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Temporary storage for information, including applications and documents. The information must be stored to a
      permanent device, such as a hard disc or CD-ROM before the power is turned off, or the information will be lost.
      Computer memory is measured in terms of the amount of information it can store, commonly in megabytes or
      gigabytes.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Menu :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A context-related list of options that users can choose from.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Menu bar :</strong></dt>
    <dd>The horizontal strip across the top of an application's window. Each word on the strip has a context sensitive
      drop-down menu containing features and actions that are available for the application in use.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Merge :</strong></dt>
    <dd>To combine two or more files into a single file.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>MHz :</strong></dt>
    <dd>An abbreviation for Megahertz, or one million hertz. One MHz represents one million clock cycles per second and
      is the measure of a computer microprocessor's speed. For example, a microprocessor that runs at 300 MHz executes
      300 million cycles per second. Each instruction a computer receives takes a fixed number of clock cycles to carry
      out, therefore the more cycles a computer can execute per second, the faster its programs run. Megahertz is also a
      unit of measure for bandwidth.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Microprocessor :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A complete central processing unit (CPU) contained on a single silicon chip.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Minimize :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A term used in a GUI operating system that uses windows. It refers to reducing a window to an icon, or a label
      at the bottom of the screen, allowing another window to be viewed.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Modem :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A device that connects two computers together over a telephone or cable line by converting the computer's data
      into an audio signal. Modem is a contraction for the process it performs : modulate-demodulate.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Monitor :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A video display terminal.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Mouse :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A small hand-held device, similar to a trackball, used to control the position of the cursor on the video
      display; movements of the mouse on a desktop correspond to movements of the cursor on the screen.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>MP3 :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Compact audio and video file format. The small size of the files makes them easy to download and e-mail. Format
      used in portable playback devices.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>Multimedia :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Software programs that combine text and graphics with sound, video, and animation. A multimedia PC contains the
      hardware to support these capabilities.</dd>

    <br><dt><strong>MS-DOS :</strong></dt>
