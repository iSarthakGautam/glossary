        Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, a method of spreading information across several disks set up to act as a
        unit, using two different techniques:

        <li>Disk striping - storing a bit of information across several discs (instead of storing it all on one disc and
          hoping that the disc doesn't crash).</li>

        <li>Disk mirroring - simultaneously storing a copy of information on another disc so that the information can be
          recovered if the main disc crashes.</li>

      </ol>

    <dt><strong>RAM :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Random Access Memory, one of two basic types of memory. Portions of programs are stored in RAM when the program
      is launched so that the program will run faster. Though a PC has a fixed amount of RAM, only portions of it will
      be accessed by the computer at any given time. Also called memory.</dd>

    <dt><strong>ROM :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Read-Only Memory, one of two basic types of memory. ROM contains only permanent information put there by the
      manufacturer. Information in ROM cannot be altered, nor can the memory be dynamically allocated by the computer or
      its operator.</dd>
