  <dl>
    <br>Palm :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A hand-held computer.</dd>

    <br>PC :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Personal computer. Generally refers to computers running Windows with a Pentium processor.

    <br>PC board :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Printed Circuit board, a board printed or etched with a circuit and processors. Power supplies, information
      storage devices, or changers are attached.

    <br>PDA :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Personal Digital Assistant, a hand-held computer that can store daily appointments, phone numbers, addresses,
      and other important information. Most PDAs link to a desktop or laptop computer to download or upload information.

    <br>PDF :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Portable Document Format, a format presented by Adobe Acrobat that allows documents to be shared over a variety
      of operating systems. Documents can contain words and pictures and be formatted to have electronic links to other
      parts of the document or to places on the web.

    <br>Pentium chip :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Intel's fifth generation of sophisticated high-speed microprocessors. Pentium means the fifth element.

    <br>Peripheral :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Any external device attached to a computer to enhance operation. Examples include external hard drive, scanner,
      printer, speakers, keyboard, mouse, trackball, stylus and tablet, and joystick.

    <br>Personal computer (PC) :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A single-user computer containing a central processing unit (CPU) and one or more memory circuits.

    <br>Petabyte :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A measure of memory or storage capacity and is approximately a thousand terabytes.

    <br>Petaflop :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A theoretical measure of a computer's speed and can be expressed as a thousand-trillion floating-point
      operations per second.

    <br>Platform :</strong></dt>
    <dd>The operating system, such as UNIX, Macintosh, Windows, on which a computer is based.

    <br>Plug and play :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Computer hardware or peripherals that come set up with necessary software so that when attached to a computer,
      they are recognized by the computer and are ready to use.

    <br>Pop-up menu :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A menu window that opens vertically or horizontally on-screen to display context-related options. Also called
      drop-down menu or pull-down menu.

    <br>Power PC :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A competitor of the Pentium chip. It is a new generation of powerful sophisticated microprocessors produced from
      an Apple-IBM-Motorola alliance.

    <br>Printer :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A mechanical device for printing a computer's output on paper. There are three major types of printer:

      <ol>
        <li><u>Dot matrix</u> - creates individual letters, made up of a series of tiny ink dots, by punching a ribbon
          with the ends of tiny wires. (This type of printer is most often used in industrial settings, such as direct
          mail for labelling.)</li>

        <li><u>Ink jet</u> - sprays tiny droplets of ink particles onto paper.</li>

        <li><u>Laser</u> - uses a beam of light to reproduce the image of each page using a magnetic charge that
          attracts dry toner that is transferred to paper and sealed with heat.</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>

    <br>Program :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A precise series of instructions written in a computer language that tells the computer what to do and how to do
      it. Programs are also called software or applications.</dd>

    <br>Programming language :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A series of instructions written by a programmer according to a given set of rules or conventions (syntax).<br>
      High-level programming languages are independent of the device on which the application (or program) will
      eventually run; low-level languages are specific to each program or platform. Programming language instructions
      are converted into programs in language specific to a particular machine or operating system (machine language).So
      that the computer can interpret and carry out the instructions. Some common programming languages are BASIC,
      C,C++, dBASE, FORTRAN, and Perl.</dd>

    <br>Puck :</strong></dt>
    <dd>An input device, like a mouse. It has a magnifying glass with crosshairs on the front of it that allows the
      operator to position it precisely when tracing a drawing for use with CAD-CAM software.</dd>

    <br>Pull-down menu :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A menu window that opens vertically on-screen to display context-related options. Also called drop-down menu or
      pop-up menu.</dd>

    <br>Push technology :</strong></dt>
    <dd>Internet tool that delivers specific information directly to a user's desktop, eliminating the need to surf for
      it. PointCast, which delivers news in user-defined categories, is a popular example of this technology.</dd>
