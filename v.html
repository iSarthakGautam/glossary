    <dt><strong>Video teleconferencing :</strong></dt>
    A remote "face-to-face chat," when two or more people using a webcam and an Internet telephone connection chat
    online. The webcam enables both live voice and video.

    <dt><strong>Virtual reality (VR) :</strong></dt>
    <dd>A technology that allows one to experience and interact with images in a simulated three-dimensional
      environment. For example, you could design a room in a house on your computer and actually feel that you are
      walking around in it even though it was never built. (The Holodeck in the science-fiction TV series Star Trek :
      Voyager would be the ultimate virtual reality.) Current technology requires the user to wear a special helmet,
      viewing goggles, gloves, and other equipment that transmits and receives information from the computer.

    <dt><strong>Virus :</strong></dt>
    <dd> An unauthorized piece of computer code attached to a computer program or portions of a computer system that
      secretly copies itself from one computer to another by shared discs and over telephone and cable lines. It can
      destroy information stored on the computer, and in extreme cases, can destroy operability. Computers can be
      protected from viruses if the operator utilizes good virus prevention software and keeps the virus definitions
      up to date. Most viruses are not programmed to spread themselves. They have to be sent to another computer by
      e-mail, sharing, or applications.The worm is an exception, because it is programmed to replicate itself by
      sending copies to other computers listed in the e-mail address book in the computer. There are many kinds of
      viruses, for example:

      <ol>
        <li>Boot viruses place some of their code in the start-up disk sector to automatically execute when booting.
          Therefore, when an infected machine boots, the virus loads and runs.</li>

        <li>File viruses attached to program files (files with the extension .exe). When you run the infected program,
          the virus code executes.</li>

        <li>Macro viruses copy their macros to templates and/or other application document files.</li>

        <li>Trojan Horse is a malicious, security-breaking program that is disguised as something being such as a
          screen saver or game.</li>

        <li>Worm launches an application that destroys information on your hard drive. It also sends a copy of the
          virus to everyone in the computer's e-mail address book.</li>
